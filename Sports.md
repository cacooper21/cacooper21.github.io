# Sports

This page is dedicated to my career in sports.

## Middle School

I played a lot of baseball ever since I was little and the first team you actually get to try out for is your middle school team. I was never exactly gifted with height but felt I played so much there was no reason why I shouldn't be on this team. I tried out both years of middle school only to be cut both years. This really took a toll on me as I started to believe I wasn't good enough. I decided to keep the slip that said I got cut and use it as motivation and work harder. I joined a very competitive travel baseball team that shaped me into the ball player I am today. I haven't been cut from a team since.

## High School

Before high school I played plenty of baseball and even a little football. High school is where I played probably the most competitive baseball up until this point of my life. I played two years of varsity baseball with Freshman and JV mixed in for my first two years. In 2017, we were able to win the state championship losing just one game all year. After high school I wanted to keep playing but couldn't find a school where I genuinely had an interest in any of their programs while being able to play baseball at the next level. I found Quinnipiac and decided to put my playing days on hold for the time being.

## College

After getting settled into college, I decided to just willingly go and try to walk on to the Quinnipiac baseball team just for the hell of it. I knew it probably wasn't in the stars for me but I wanted to give it a shot anyways. My roommate introduced me to his friend who was also trying out and we became friends through the whole tryout process. After the tryouts we found out we didn't make the cut. After that we realized that it still wasn't good enough for us to just give up. We decided to bring something to Quinnipiac people tried to in the past but never quite got it going. Club baseball. It was a lot of work but we brought an unaffiliated club baseball team to campus. We poured so much work into this team and went from 0-4 in our first year to ACBA champions in 2019. I was able to continue to play the sport I love and be able to say I was one of the guys that started the team from scratch. We are still unaffiliated today awaiting Quinnipiac's recognition.
