## Hamden Braves Club Baseball
In 2017, I co-founded this club team as part to bring club sports to campus and continue playing the game I love. Being that at that time, Quinnipiac had no club sports, we established ourselves as a non profit organization and have operated that way since. Not long after holding tryouts and putting in a ton of work behind the scenes, we won the 2019 ACBA championship. I've personally done a lot of work with this team from fundraising at Eli's, to creating a schedule and reserving fields through surrounding towns. A lot of hard work that has paid off.

## Computer Build
This past Fall, I researched and purchased all the parts needed to build my own personal PC. It took over a year to assemble and get all the parts needed. The computer runs on Windows 10 and helped increase my knowledge of how computers run.

## Giants Podcast
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I started a New York Giants podcast with my cousin. I started it for fun with him but then we got a small enough audience to actually make something of it. I made a Twitter account and got more of a following from there. My knowledge for the sport was already good, but now has grown more since the start. I began reaching out and connecting with new people just talking about football. We have been still keeping up with the podcast today.

## Website Build
Over winter break, way before I knew how to create a website on Github, designed a website for my dad's work. I kept it really user-friendly and they liked it enough where they have used it ever since.
