# Projects

## SER 225 Video Game Project
During the Fall semester of 2020, my group was tasked with working in team based SCRUM Sprints using Java to develop a "Mario" like game using Eclipse and Github and turn it into a prototype consisting of multiple levels and added features. I focused primarily on enemy development and created the very last level of the game. To check out this project, click [here](https://github.com/mchrpt/SER-225-Game-Master) to view the repository.

## Symptom Checker App
This past semester, my group got tasked by making a project that benefits the Quinnipiac community. Our group decided to make a prototype that replicates some of the features found on the Quinnipiac Symptom Checker App. This program runs in the terminal and allows the user to manually put in test dates and view their upcoming test dates with using the calendar view.
