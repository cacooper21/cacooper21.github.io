# Projects


## CSC 225: Project Report and Development of Startup Video Game
During the Fall semester of 2020, my group was tasked with working in team based SCRUM Sprints using Java to develop a "Mario" like game using Eclipse and Github and turn it into a prototype consisting of multiple levels and added features. I focused primarily on enemy development and created the very last level of the game.

## CSC 111: Coding project: Game of War
During the Spring semester of 2020, for my groups final project we decided to code the card game "War". This was developed in Eclipse in Java and basically has two CPU's play against each other until one of the CPU's runs out of cards. The game runs in the terminal and prints out the result of each round.
